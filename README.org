Dirty little scripts to automate a WRF model run.

Expects ~dirnames.sh~ with definitions of environment variables in current
working directory. see ~newrun.sh~

I keep the following Structure. Some of the folders are created automatically
by [[https://github.com/yyr/wrf_install][wrf_install]] package.

Folder structure:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 ~/DATA/
    |
    |-> SST
    |    |-> case1
    |    |-> case2
    |
    |-> FNL

 ~/wrf/
    |-> run
    |    |-> bin  -- links of executables (wrf.exe, real.exe, geogrid.exe ...)
    |    |-> tbls -- Vtables at one place.
    |    |-> case1
    |    |-> case2
    |         ...
    |
    |->  gcc  -- wrf build with gcc compiler
    |
    |->  intel -- wrf build with intel compiler
    |
    |->  src  -- sources of wrf and its dependencies.
